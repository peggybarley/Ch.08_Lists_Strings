'''
1.)
Write a single program that takes any of the three lists, and prints the average. 
Use the len function. There is a sum function I haven't told you about. 
Don't use that. Sum the numbers individually as shown in the chapter. 
Also, a common mistake is to calculate the average each time through the loop 
to add the numbers. Finish adding the numbers before you divide.
'''

a_list = [3, 12, 3, 5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 5, 3, 5, 6, 3, 2, 4]
b_list = [4, 15, 2, 7, 8, 3, 1, 10, 9]
c_list = [5, 10, 13, 12, 5, 9, 2, 6, 1, 8, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 8, 2, 2, 6, 3, 9, 8, 10]
total = 0

print()
print("Welcome to Peggy's list program!")
while True:
    print("Which list would you like to select?")
    uChoice = int(input("\n 1. List A \n 2. List B \n 3. List C \n  "))
    print()
    if uChoice == 1:
        uChoice = a_list
    elif uChoice == 2:
        uChoice = b_list
    elif uChoice == 3:
        uChoice = c_list
    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
        continue
    break
for item in uChoice:
    total += item
print()
print(f"The average of your selected list is: {total/len(uChoice):.3} ")


'''
2.) Write a program that will strip the username (whatever is in front of the @ symbol)
from any e-mail address and print it. First ask the user for their e-mail address.
'''

while True:
    email = input("What is your email address?")
    username = ""
    for item in email:
        if item != "@":
            break
        username += item
    print(username)

'''
TEXT FORMATTING:
3.) Make following program output the following:


     Score:          41,237
     High score:  1,023,407
     
     Do not use any plus sign (+) in your code.
     You should only have two double quotes in each print statement.
 '''

score = 41237
highScore = 1023407
print(f"Score:      {score:>9}")
print(f"High score: {highScore:>9}")
